# Reaction-Network-Modeling-with-Markov-Chains

This is a project to predict the existance and reachability of absorbing states 
in reaction networks. The code here models reaction networks as discrete time Markov chains using Matlab. 
The file ExistanceReachability_Absorbing_States.m contains some examples of networks that are modeled by using the functions
written on the other files.
